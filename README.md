# Obsidian Self-Contract Plugin

A simple but powerful plugin to turn your goals into unbreakable promises. Create, manage, and track personal commitments and contracts directly within Obsidian.

### Why Self-Contract?

Ever set a goal, write a to-do list, or make a promise to yourself, only to see it fade away after a few days? The human brain responds powerfully to formal commitments. **Self-Contract** leverages this by allowing you to create a formal "contract" with yourself.

By defining stakes, setting clear milestones, and formalizing your intentions, you can transform vague goals into concrete commitments you're motivated to keep.### ✨ Features

- **✍️ Create Contracts:** Use a clean, predefined template to formalize your goals.
- **🎯 Set Milestones:** Break down large commitments into small, manageable steps.
- **📊 Track Progress:** Visually see how far you've come and what's left to do.
- **⚙️ Simple & Focused:** No unnecessary complexity. Just you and your commitments.
